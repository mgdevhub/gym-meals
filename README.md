# GymMeals - Performance Architected

**High-Performance Nutrition Reasoning Engine (Gemini 3.0)**

---

## 🏛️ Inspiration: Rebuilding Strength
GymMeals was born from the resilience of the **Hatay earthquake recovery**. In the aftermath of destruction, we realized that rebuilding—whether a city or a human body—requires more than just resources; it requires **precise architecture**.

We built GymMeals with a singular mission: **To be the "Performance Architect" for your biology.**

Most fitness apps are passive calculators. We wanted an AI that strictly enforces discipline, acting like a high-performance dietician who helps you rebuild your strength with clinical precision and authority.

## 🧠 Technical Depth: Gemini 3.0 Reasoning Engine

GymMeals is not just a wrapper. It is a **Reasoning Engine** built entirely around the **Gemini 3.0 Flash/Pro** API. We moved beyond simple image classification to "Multimodal Biological Analysis."

### 🔬 Anabolic Scoring Logic
The core of our engine is the **Anabolic Score (1-10)**. Gemini 3.0 doesn't just "see" food; it evaluates its biological value for hypertrophy based on:
1.  **Bioavailability**: How efficiently can the body utilize this protein?
2.  **Glycemic Stability**: Is this fuel compatible with the user's current metabolic state (e.g., Post-Workout vs. Bedtime)?
3.  **Leucine Threshold**: Does the meal trigger muscle protein synthesis?

### 👁️ Vision Logic
We utilize Gemini 3.0's **Multimodal Reasoning** to understand *context*.
-   **Scenario**: A high-glycemic meal (Rice/Fruit).
-   **Logic**: If "Post-Workout" -> **Score: 9.0 (Optimal Fuel)**.
-   **Logic**: If "Rest Day" -> **Score: 4.0 (Insulin Spike Risk)**.
The engine adapts its "Verdict" instantly, offering "The Fix" (e.g., "Add fibers to blunt the insulin response") rather than just a calorie count.

## 🛡️ Iron Dome Security Protocol

Security is not an afterlife; it's our baseline. GymMeals implements the **Iron Dome** protocol to ensure user privacy in high-stakes environments.

-   **Zero-Retention**: No user photos or biometrics are stored on external servers. Analysis is ephemeral.
-   **Local-First Architecture**: All personal health data is encrypted and stored locally on the device using `SecureStore`.
-   **Compliance**: Designed with strict adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and KVKK (Turkey) standards.
